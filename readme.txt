## Key features


* <strong>Real-time synchronization</strong>: Real-time synchronization uses Salesforce APIs and automatically synchronizes record changes from WordPress to Salesforce. Salesforce flows and outbound messages to sync data to WordPress in real time. Salesforce objects will be automatically created/updated/deleted when the data in WordPress is created/updated/deleted and vice-versa.

* <strong>Advanced Field mapping</strong>: Map WordPress elements such as users, posts, and custom post type data fields to the corresponding fields from the Salesforce object you've selected. The data in <a href="https://plugins.miniorange.com/Salesforce-wordpress-object-sync#step3">WordPress (WP) and Salesforce</a> would be up-to-date when the mapped fields are synchronized. You can also assign taxonomy terms to WordPress records on the basis of Salesforce field value.

* <strong>Bidirectional synchronization</strong>: The Salesforce to WordPress records sync can be configured to run at specific time intervals, performed as a one-time sync, or triggered in real-time whenever a record is updated. The plugin retrieves the data from the Salesforce object and can create / update the WordPress records based on the field mapping

* <strong>Unlimited custom field mapping</strong>: Create unlimited fields for various user data, objects, posts, custom posts, taxonomy, tables, and more, and map them to any standard or custom Salesforce objects, enabling seamless synchronization of data from WordPress to Salesforce.

* <strong>Push/Pull Existing data between Salesforce and WordPress</strong>: Synchronize your historical Salesforce data to WordPress, keeping both platforms in perfect sync. Data can be fetched from Salesforce at specified intervals, and you can filter the incoming data based on specific criteria for selected Salesforce fields.
